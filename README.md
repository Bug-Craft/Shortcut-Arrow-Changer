# Shortcut-Arrow-Changer
This is a project for hiding and displaying shortcut arrow icons.

Currently, there are many software programs available to help you hide and display shortcut arrow icons, but they can be too big and complex, and sometimes they don't support certain versions of Windows.

The purpose of this project is to use batch processing to show or hide the shortcut arrow icons, without the need for additional software. It's lightweight and simple enough to be toggled with just one keypress.

It should be compatible with many versions of Windows, but unfortunately, I can only test it on Windows 11.

Click on `Code` on the right and then `Download ZIP` to get all versions of this batch file.

`Shortcut Arrow Changer_CN.bat` only includes the Chinese version.

`Shortcut Arrow Changer_EN.bat` only includes the English version.

`Shortcut Arrow Changer_CN_EN.bat` includes both Chinese and English prompts.
